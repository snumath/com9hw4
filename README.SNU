This project is based on the materials developed by Textbook authors.
You can download the original Y86-64 tools and documentation from
http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/sim.tar

We have slightly modified the original toolset to make you focus on the
sequential implementation of Y86-64 architecture and to facilitate the
automatic grading.

The followings summarize some of the changes made:

- Makefile has been modified for "make handin".
- The original misc/isa.c file is divided into misc/isa.c and misc/isacore.c
- The original seq/ssim.c file is divided into seq/ssim.c and seq/ssimcore.c
- misc/Makefile and seq/Makefile have been changed to reflect the addition of 
  misc/isacore.c and seq/ssimcore.c files.
- Some necessary modifications have been made in misc/yas-grammar.lex, misc/isa.h,
  and misc/isa.c files to support mulq and rmmovb/mrmovb instructions.
- A new control signal called 'mem_byte' has been added to the data memory. 
  The mem_byte signal should be set to 1 for rmmovb and mrmovb instructions.
- seq/seq-std.hcl, seq/seq+-std.hcl, and seq/seq+.tcl files are removed (not used
  in this project).
- Several test programs that use mulq and rmmovb/mrmovb instructions are added
  in the ./y86-code directory.
- The ./pipe directory has been removed (not used in this project).
- A new option '-s' is added in the seq/ssim.c file for printing output for
  automatic grading server (enabled by -DSNU flag in seq/Makefile).


Have fun!
